<p>
Niels Bohr, in full Niels Henrik David Bohr, (born October 7, 1885, Copenhagen, Denmark—died November 18, 1962, Copenhagen), Danish physicist who is generally regarded as one of the foremost physicists of the 20th century. He was the first to apply the quantum concept, which restricts the energy of a system to certain discrete values, to the problem of atomic and molecular structure. For that work he received the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1922. His manifold roles in the origins and development of quantum physics may be his most-important contribution, but through his long career his involvements were substantially broader, both inside and outside the world of physics.</br>
</br></p>

<h3>Early Life</h3>
<p>
Bohr was the second of three children born into an upper middle-class Copenhagen family. His mother, Ellen (née Adler), was the daughter of a prominent Jewish banker. His father, Christian, became a professor of physiology at the University of Copenhagen and was nominated twice for the Nobel Prize.</br>
Enrolling at the University of Copenhagen in 1903, Bohr was never in doubt that he would study physics. Research and teaching in that field took place in cramped quarters at the Polytechnic Institute, leased to the University for the purpose. Bohr obtained his doctorate in 1911 with a dissertation on the electron theory of metals.</br>
On August 1, 1912, Bohr married Margrethe Nørlund, and the marriage proved a particularly happy one. Throughout his life, Margrethe was his most-trusted adviser. They had six sons, the fourth of whom, Aage N. Bohr, shared a third of the 1975 Nobel Prize for Physics in recognition of the collective model of the atomic nucleus proposed in the early 1950s.</br>
</br></p>

<h3>Bohr Atomic Model</h3>
<p>
Bohr’s first contribution to the emerging new idea of quantum physics started in 1912 during what today would be called postdoctoral research in England with Ernest Rutherford at the University of Manchester. Only the year before, Rutherford and his collaborators had established experimentally that the atom consists of a heavy positively charged nucleus with substantially lighter negatively charged electrons circling around it at considerable distance. According to classical physics, such a system would be unstable, and Bohr felt compelled to postulate, in a substantive trilogy of articles published in The Philosophical Magazine in 1913, that electrons could only occupy particular orbits determined by the quantum of action and that electromagnetic radiation from an atom occurred only when an electron jumped to a lower-energy orbit. Although radical and unacceptable to most physicists at the time, the Bohr atomic model was able to account for an ever-increasing number of experimental data, famously starting with the spectral line series emitted by hydrogen.</br>

<b>Bohr model of the atom</b></br>
In the Bohr model of the atom, electrons travel in defined circular orbits around the nucleus. The orbits are labeled by an integer, the quantum number n. Electrons can jump from one orbit to another by emitting or absorbing energy. The inset shows an electron jumping from orbit n=3 to orbit n=2, emitting a photon of red light with an energy of 1.89 eV.</br>

<h3>Bohr’s Institute For Theoretical Physics</h3>
<p>
In the spring of 1916, Bohr was offered a new professorship at the University of Copenhagen; dedicated to theoretical physics, it was the second professorship in physics there. As physics was still pursued in the cramped quarters of the Polytechnic Institute, it is not surprising that already in the spring of 1917 Bohr wrote a long letter to his faculty asking for the establishment of an Institute for Theoretical Physics. In the inauguration speech for his new institute on March 3, 1921, he stressed, first, that experiments and experimenters were indispensable at an institute for theoretical physics in order to test the statements of the theorists. Second, he expressed his ambition to make the new institute a place where the younger generation of physicists could propose fresh ideas. Starting out with a small staff, Bohr’s institute soon accomplished those goals to the highest degree.</br>
</br></p>

<h3>Nobel Prize</h3>
<p>
Already in his 1913 trilogy, Bohr had sought to apply his theory to the understanding of the periodic table of elements. He improved upon that aspect of his work into the early 1920s, by which time he had developed an elaborate scheme building up the periodic table by adding electrons one after another to the atom according to his atomic model. When Bohr was awarded the Nobel Prize for his work in 1922, the Hungarian physical chemist Georg Hevesy, together with the physicist Dirk Coster from Holland, were working at Bohr’s institute to establish experimentally that the as-yet-undiscovered atomic element 72 would behave as predicted by Bohr’s theory. They succeeded in 1923, thus proving both the strength of Bohr’s theory and the truth in practice of Bohr’s words at the institute’s inauguration about the important role of experiment. The element was named hafnium (Latin for Copenhagen).</br>
</br></p>

<h3>Copenhagen Interpretation Of Quantum Mechanics</h3>
<p>
Among physicists working at Bohr’s institute between the World Wars, the “Copenhagen Spirit” came to denote the very special social milieu there, comprising a completely informal atmosphere, the opportunity to discuss physics without any concern for other matters, and, for the specially privileged, the unique opportunity of working with Bohr.</br>
Notwithstanding the important experimental work performed by Hevesy, Coster, and others, it was the theorists who led the way. In 1925 Werner Heisenberg of Germany developed the revolutionary quantum mechanics, which, in contrast to its predecessor, the so-called “old quantum theory” that drew on classical physics, constituted a fully independent theory. During the academic year 1926–27, Heisenberg served as Bohr’s assistant in Copenhagen, where he formulated the fundamental uncertainty principle as a consequence of quantum mechanics. Bohr, Heisenberg, and a few others then went on to develop what came to be known as the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, which still provides a conceptual basis for the theory. A central element of the Copenhagen interpretation is Bohr’s complementarity principle, presented for the first time in 1927 at a conference in Como, Italy. According to complementarity, on the atomic level a physical phenomenon expresses itself differently depending on the experimental setup used to observe it. Thus, light appears sometimes as waves and sometimes as particles. For a complete explanation, both aspects, which according to classical physics are contradictory, need to be taken into account. The other towering figure of physics in the 20th century, Albert Einstein, never accepted the Copenhagen interpretation, famously declaring against its probabilistic implications that “God does not play dice.” The discussions between Bohr and Einstein, especially at two of the renowned series of Solvay Conferences in physics, in 1927 and 1930, constitute one of the most-fundamental and inspired discussions between physicists in the 20th century. For the rest of his life, Bohr worked to generalize complementarity as a guiding idea applying far beyond physics.</br>
</br></p>

<h3>Nuclear Physics</h3>
<p>
In the early 1930s Bohr found use once more for his fund-raising abilities and his vision of a fruitful combination of theory and experiment. He realized early that the research front in theoretical physics was moving from the study of the atom as a whole to the study of its nucleus. Bohr turned to the Rockefeller Foundation, whose “experimental biology” program was designed to improve conditions for the life sciences. Together with Hevesy and the Danish physiologist August Krogh, Bohr applied for support to build a cyclotron—a kind of particle accelerator recently invented by Ernest O. Lawrence in the United States—as a means to pursue biological studies. Although Bohr intended to use the cyclotron primarily for investigations in nuclear physics, it could also produce isotopes of elements involved in organic processes, making it possible in particular to extend the radioactive indicator method, invented and promoted by Hevesy, to biological purposes. In addition to the support from the Rockefeller Foundation, funds for the cyclotron and other equipment for studying the nucleus were also granted to Bohr from Danish sources.</br>
</br></p>

<h3>Splitting The Atom</h3>
<p>
Just as the close connection between theory and experiment had proved fruitful for atomic physics, so now the same connection came to work well in the study of the nucleus. Thus, after the German physicists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in late 1938 had made the unexpected and unexplained experimental discovery that a uranium atom can be split in two approximately equal halves when bombarded with neutrons, a theoretical explanation based on Bohr’s recently proposed theory of the compound nucleus was suggested by two Austrian physicists close to Bohr—Lise Meitner and her nephew Otto Robert Frisch; the explanation was soon confirmed in experiments by Meitner and Frisch at the institute. By that time, at the beginning of 1939, Bohr was in the United States, where a fierce race to confirm experimentally the so-called fission of the nucleus began after the news of the German experiments and their explanation had become known. In the United States, Bohr did pathbreaking work with his younger American colleague John Archibald Wheeler at Princeton University to explain fission theoretically.</br>
</br></p>

<h3>Helping The Refugees</h3>
<p>
Bohr had felt the consequences of the Nazi regime almost as soon as Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany in 1933, as several of his colleagues there were of Jewish descent and lost their jobs without any prospect of a future in their home country. Bohr used his connections with well-established foundations—as well as the newly set up Danish Committee for the Support of Refugee Intellectual Workers, in which he sat on the executive board from its creation in 1933—to get physicists out of Germany in order for them to spend some time at Bohr’s institute before obtaining permanent appointment elsewhere, most often in the United States.</br>
</br></p>

<h3>The Atomic Bomb</h3>
<p>
After the discovery of fission, Bohr was acutely aware of the theoretical possibility of making an atomic bomb. However, as he announced in lectures in Denmark and in Norway just before the German occupation of both countries in April 1940, he considered the practical difficulties so prohibitive as to prevent the realization of a bomb until well after the war could be expected to end. Even when Heisenberg at his visit to Copenhagen in 1941 told Bohr about his role in a German atomic bomb project, Bohr did not waver from that conviction.</br>
In early 1943 Bohr received a secret message from his British colleague James Chadwick, inviting Bohr to join him in England to do important scientific work. Although Chadwick’s letter was vaguely formulated, Bohr understood immediately that the work had to do with developing an atomic bomb. Still convinced of the infeasibility of such a project, Bohr answered that there was greater need for him in occupied Denmark.</br>
In the fall of 1943, the political situation in Denmark changed dramatically after the Danish government’s collaboration with the German occupiers broke down. After being warned about his imminent arrest, Bohr escaped by boat with his family across the narrow sound to Sweden. In Stockholm the invitation to England was repeated, and Bohr was brought by a military airplane to Scotland and then on to London. Only a few days later he was joined by his son Aage, a fledgling physicist of age 21, who would serve as his father’s indispensable sounding board during their absence from Denmark.</br>
Upon being briefed about the state of the Allied atomic bomb project on his arrival in London, Bohr changed his mind immediately about its feasibility. Concerned about a corresponding project being pursued in Germany, Bohr willingly joined the Allied project. Taking part for several weeks at a time in the work in Los Alamos, New Mexico, to develop the atomic bomb, he made significant technical contributions, notably to the design of the so-called initiator for the plutonium bomb. His most-important role, however, was to serve, in J. Robert Oppenheimer’s words, “as a scientific father confessor to the younger men.”</br>
</br></p>

<h3>An “Open World”</h3>
<p>
Early on during his exile, Bohr became convinced that the existence of the bomb would “not only seem to necessitate but should also, due to the urgency of mutual confidence, facilitate a new approach to the problems of international relationship.” The first step toward avoiding a postwar nuclear arms race would be to inform the ally in the war, the Soviet Union, of the project. Bohr set out on a solitary campaign, during which he even succeeded in obtaining personal interviews with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt. He was unable to convince either of them of his viewpoint, however, instead being suspected by Churchill of spying for the Russians. After the war, Bohr persisted in his mission for what he called an “open world” between nations, continuing his confidential contact with statesmen and writing an open letter to the United Nations in 1950.</br>
Bohr was allowed to return home only after the atomic bomb had been dropped on Japan in August 1945. In Denmark he was greeted as a hero, some newspapers even welcoming him with pride as the Dane who had invented the atomic bomb. He continued to run and expand his institute, and he was central in postwar institution building for physics. On a national scale, he took a major part in establishing the research facility at Risø, near Roskilde, only a few miles outside Copenhagen, created in order to prepare the introduction of nuclear power in Denmark, which, however, has never occurred. Internationally, he took part in the establishment of CERN, the European experimental particle physics facility near Geneva, Switzerland, as well as of the Nordic Institute for Atomic Physics (Nordita) adjacent to his institute. Bohr left behind an unsurpassed scientific legacy, as well as an institute that remains one of the leading centres for theoretical physics in the world.</br>
